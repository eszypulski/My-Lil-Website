    <h1>What I know about HTML</h1>
    <div class="thinBod">
    <h3>How I learned &#128585;</h3>
    <p>When I was a middle school kid (ca. 1998), I used this extremely late 90s website called <a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/">Lissa Explains</a> to customize my Neopets storefront and create incredibly ugly websites with my friends. A decade later, I had to write simple HTML when I worked for an educational website. We had an in-house WYSIWYG editor, but it messed up anything too complicated, so after a while, it was easier to do certain things (nested lists, certain types of image alignment) with code. I rarely use it now, but during the early part of the pandemic, my husband (a high school teacher) suddenly had to suddenly put a lot of content online via various janky LMSs, and I would occasionally edit the code manually when he was having trouble with formatting.</p>
    <h3>Some simple things I can do &#127947;</h3>
    <p>I can do:
        <ul><li><i>Italics</i>
             <ul>
                <li>Useful for emphasis</li>
                <li>Also sometimes for titles</li>
                <li>Or in some novels, dialogue</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><b>Bold</b>
            <ul>
                <li>I use this for keywords when I'm writing instructional text. (e.g., Click the <b>Submit</b> button.)</li>
                <li>I guess it could convey <b>STRONG EMOTION</b>, but that feels a bit much</li>
                <li>Too many people just do this for headings rather than using styles</li>
            </ul></li>
    <li><u>Underline</u>
        <ul>
            <li>Not frequently used</li>
            <li>This is how I learned to do book titles (<u>Moby Dick</u>), but in actual style guides, I feel like I see <i>Moby Dick</i> more often.</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p>And more!</p>
    <h3>Other thoughts &#127774;</h3>
    <P>I often miss this version of the internet. Wouldn't it be nice if instead of social media, we all had our own simple little websites? We don't have to go back to the days of under construction GIFs... but maybe I would anyway.</P>

    <h3>Quotes</h3>
    <p>I feel like personal websites would often include quotes? Here are the first two paragraphs of the book I've been re-reading, <u>Anna Karenina</u>:
        <blockquote>
           <p>Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.</p>

<p>Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house. The wife had discovered that the husband was carrying on an intrigue with a French girl, who had been a governess in their family, and she had announced to her husband that she could not go on living in the same house with him. This position of affairs had now lasted three days, and not only the husband and wife themselves, but all the members of their family and household, were painfully conscious of it. Every person in the house felt that there was so sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they, the members of the family and household of the Oblonskys. The wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not been at home for three days. The children ran wild all over the house; the English governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and the coachman had given warning.
